"""Every protocol the authentication layer defines: what a scheme is, and where a token comes from.

Two families, one file. :class:`AuthScheme` and its async twin are the whole contract for applying a
credential to a request, so a scheme this runtime does not ship is a class a *caller* writes; ``apply``
runs once per request, which is what makes rotation and just-in-time signing work.
:class:`TokenSource` and its three relatives are the seam managed OAuth 2.0 fetches through, so a
consumer replaces the built-in source without touching the caching scheme that calls it.

Nothing here has a body, so nothing here reaches a scheme, a composite or a transport -- only the
models its members name."""
