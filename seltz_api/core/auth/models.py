"""What every security scheme trades in, and the OAuth 2.0 vocabulary its grants share.

:class:`AuthParams` is what one scheme contributes to a request. The rest is managed OAuth 2.0's
grant-agnostic half: the token endpoint's success and error bodies (RFC 6749 §5.1 and §5.2, fixed for
every provider, which is why they are runtime types at all), §2.3.1's client-authentication placements,
§3.3's scope delimiter, and the scope vocabulary parameter every grant's credentials carry.

The bottom of the auth layer. It names no protocol and no scheme, so ``protocols``, ``composition`` and
``schemes/`` all import from here and nothing imports back. It performs no token request either --
which is why no ``RawClient``, ``form_body`` or ``UrlTemplate`` appears below."""
