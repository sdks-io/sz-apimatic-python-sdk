"""Request parameters and the unresolved URL they are attached to.

A :class:`Param` is one query, header, path or form parameter: a key, the value the endpoint
received, and the adapter for the type it was declared as. The declared type decides how the value
reaches the wire -- a temporal alias carries its own serializer, so ``RFC1123DateTime`` and
``UnixSecondsDateTime`` render the same ``datetime`` as a string and as an int -- and is what
dict-shaped input is validated against. How a *collection* explodes into keys is the one choice a
type cannot express, so it stays a field (:class:`SerializationFormat`)."""

    Only those two destinations can honour it, because only they can repeat or subscript a key. A

    field value -- OpenAPI's default ``style: simple`` for both, and RFC 9110's own rule for a
    repeated header -- so a path or header :class:`Param` carries this field and nothing reads it.
    That is the price of one ``Param`` and one :func:`param` factory serving every location a
    parameter can occupy, and it is a price rather than a defect: the alternative is a parameter
    type per destination, and with it a generator branch deciding which to emit -- the conditional
    emission ADR-0012 removed.

    The remaining path and header styles -- ``label``, ``matrix``, ``explode: true`` -- are not

    """One request parameter, not yet flattened onto the wire.

    ``T`` is the endpoint's declared type in full, dict-shaped companion included -- exactly what
    ``param[...]`` accepts -- while the adapter targets :func:`validation_target` of it, which is
    what the value is validated *into*. ``value`` is typed ``object`` all the same, deliberately:
    every consumer holds a ``Param[Any]``, where a ``T``-typed field would read as ``Any`` and be
    checked as nothing, so ``object`` leaves the adapter as the only route to the value. The
    *resolved* adapter is held rather than the type expression it came from, so the one cache
    lookup happens when the parameter is built rather than on every flatten.

    Unlike a request body, a parameter is deliberately *not* serialized when it is built: query,
    header and path parameters are merged per key with the API-wide ``global_*`` sets while the
    request is being built, so they have to stay inspectable until then. ``wire_value``
    (``_internal/wire.py``) performs the same validate-then-dump through this ``adapter`` at that
    point, for every destination; each destination then decides only how the result is arranged --
    into query pairs, path segments, or one header value.

    Construct it through ``param[...]``, whose subscript is where ``T`` is bound.

    Two parameters compare equal when key, value and format match *and* they share an adapter.
    Adapters are cached per type by :func:`adapter_for`, so that holds for any cacheable type; an
    unhashable type form bypasses the cache and would make two otherwise-identical parameters
    unequal. Nothing depends on it -- resolution keys on ``key`` alone."""

    have inference absorb the disagreement. And because the factory declares no ``__call__``,
    *omitting* the declared type is a build failure too: ``param("array", True)`` is rejected
    statically (``[operator]``); the runtime ``__call__`` below is invisible to type checkers
    and exists only to turn that same mistake into a guided ``TypeError``.
