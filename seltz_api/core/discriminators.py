"""A discriminated union whose tag the variants need not carry.

OpenAPI puts ``discriminator`` on the ``oneOf``/``anyOf`` node rather than on the schemas it
selects, so the property name and the value-to-schema mapping are the union's facts. A schema that
does not pin that property itself can appear in two unions under two different property names and
two different tag values, and a model carrying one union's tag in a field could never serve the
other.

:class:`WireDiscriminator` routes on that tag without requiring the variants to carry it. Each arm
carries pydantic's ``Tag`` with the mapping value the spec gave it; the metadata names the wire
property. **The union supplies the tag exactly where the variant has no field for it** -- removing
the key before such a variant validates, and writing it back when such a variant is dumped -- so one
model round-trips through every union that references it, and a variant's field set stays exactly its
own schema's.

A variant whose schema *does* declare the property keeps that field, and the union leaves it alone in
both directions: the key reaches the field, and the field dumps it back. The field is read through
its alias, so the tag may arrive under the wire spelling or under the field's own name.

Several mapping values may select the same variant. Each value is its own arm, so each routes; the
first one the union lists is the spelling a model instance dumps through, since a model carries no
tag of its own to disambiguate them.

**Every discriminated union names this one metadata, whatever its arms declare.** Pydantic's own
``Field(discriminator=...)`` can serve only the narrowest case -- every arm pinning the property to a
constant equal to its own mapping value, under one shared field name, one value per arm -- and it
requires a ``Literal``, refusing a plain ``str``. Reserving it for that case would make the emitting
template resolve every arm's schema and compare it against the mapping before it could choose a
shape, and a wrong comparison routes on a value the spec never named. One shape, decided from the
union node alone, is the trade."""
