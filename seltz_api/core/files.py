"""What a caller may hand an endpoint as file input, and how a part describes itself.

A file never reaches the model layer. It is not validated by pydantic, not dumped through an
adapter, and not carried on ``SdkBaseModel`` -- which is why a file parameter names no declared
type in a subscript where every other parameter does: there is no adapter for it to name.

**One vocabulary, both destinations.** ``FileInput`` is what a raw request body and a multipart
part alike accept, and only the concurrency flavour tells it from ``AsyncFileInput``. Where a
destination cannot carry an arm natively it is adapted rather than refused, so nothing type-checks
here that does not reach the wire.

**Memory and ownership.** Every spelling below streams except ``bytes``, which the caller already
holds. A ``Path`` is opened by the transport on the send's ``ExitStack`` and read in 64 KiB chunks,
so the safest spelling is also the shortest one -- and the handle the transport opened is closed
when the send returns or raises, never later and never by a finalizer. A handle *you* open stays
yours: the SDK never closes a caller-supplied reader.

**Position, and single use.** A multipart part rewinds a seekable handle to 0 before reading it; a
raw body reads from wherever it sits. That is the underlying library's rule, and it is stated here
because it decides what happens to a handle you hand in mid-file. An iterable of chunks has no
position at all: it is consumed once, in either destination, and cannot be re-sent.

**The async multipart caveat, stated where it bites.** httpx encodes a multipart body from a
synchronous chunk generator in both flavours (``MultipartStream.__aiter__`` yields from
``iter_chunks``), so on the async client each 64 KiB read of a *sync* arm is a blocking syscall on
the loop thread. An *async* source cannot be pulled from inside that generator at all, so one handed
to a part is drained to a temp file first -- awaited natively, a chunk at a time, so it costs a
write and not residency; the file lives on the send's ``ExitStack`` and carries a real ``fileno``,
which is what keeps the part sized and re-sendable. **The chunk is 64 KiB for a reader, and your own
for an iterable** -- an ``AsyncIterable``'s pieces are forwarded as you yield them, so a generator
that yields its whole payload in one ``bytes`` has already made it resident before the SDK sees it,
where one that yields windows never does. Nothing accumulates on top of that in either case. A raw
binary body has neither cost: every sync arm is adapted to an async stream reading through
``asyncio.to_thread``, and the two async arms are consumed natively.

**If those bytes are a file on disk, hand over the ``Path`` and not an async handle.** This is the
one place in the file surface where the natural-looking spelling is the wrong one. A ``Path`` in a
multipart part is read once, straight to the socket. The same file behind an ``anyio`` handle is
read, written to the spill file, and read back -- two reads and a write to deliver bytes that were
already sitting on disk in the form the encoder wanted. The async arms are for content that has no
path: bytes arriving from another connection, a queue, a subprocess. Reach for them when there is
nothing to name, not when naming it is merely less convenient.

**And what the spill costs, since it is the one place the SDK writes to disk.** It is created by
``mkstemp`` -- mode 0600 on POSIX, the temp directory's own ACL on Windows -- and unlinked
immediately where the platform allows, so on POSIX it has no name for the whole of its life and is
reclaimed even if the process is killed. Three consequences a deployment may care about, none of
them hidden:

* the location is the standard one, so ``TMPDIR`` / ``TEMP`` redirects it -- and if that directory
  is a **tmpfs**, the bytes are back in RAM, bounded page cache rather than bounded memory;
* it needs room. A payload larger than the temp filesystem, or a read-only one with nowhere to
  write, raises ``OSError`` from the drain, where the same upload previously only risked memory;
* the payload is briefly at rest on disk. Unnamed and per-user, but on disk, which a policy that
  forbids that will care about.

The time cost is smaller than it reads: the read-back comes from the page cache rather than the
platter (measured at memory speed), and past a few hundred MiB the drain is *faster* than the
``bytes`` it replaced, because allocating and copying a payload that size costs more than streaming
it through a file. None of this applies to any other arm -- nothing else here writes to disk."""
