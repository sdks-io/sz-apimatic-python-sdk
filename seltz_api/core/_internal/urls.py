"""Turning a :class:`UrlTemplate` plus parameters into a request URL.

Five pure functions in three groups. :func:`resolve_params` combines the parameters an API applies
to every request with the ones a single call declares; :func:`render_segments` turns each of those
into the URL segments it contributes, reading its declared type; :func:`build_url` then renders the
result, with server variables filling the base URL's placeholders, path parameters filling the
path's, and query parameters flattened and encoded onto the end. Resolution stays separate from
rendering so each can be tested on its own, and none of the five holds state -- there is nothing to
configure, so there is nothing to construct."""

def expand_template(template: str, segments: Mapping[str, tuple[str, ...]]) -> str:
    """Substitute every ``{placeholder}`` in ``template`` from ``segments``.

    Each value is the sequence of *unencoded* members its placeholder expands from. Members are
    percent-encoded with no safe characters and joined with ``,``, so a collection fills one path
    segment rather than several -- OpenAPI's ``style: simple`` with ``explode: false``, the default
    for a path parameter, and the same rule ``headers.py`` applies to a header array.

    Encoding happens per member, *before* the join, which is what keeps the two commas apart: the
    separator is written here and stays literal (a sub-delimiter under RFC 3986), while a comma
    carried by a value is encoded to ``%2C`` along with everything else non-unreserved. A value
    still cannot inject a path separator, for the same reason.

    Any ``{name}`` is a placeholder -- the braces delimit it, so the name is not restricted to word
    characters and a kebab-case or dotted path parameter resolves like any other. A name with no
    segment raises rather than passing through: unencoded braces are not valid in a URL anyway.

    Deciding what a value's members *are* belongs to :func:`render_segments`, which is the only
    thing holding a declared type. This function therefore has one rule rather than four, and both
    the join and the encoding live in exactly one place.

    Args:
        template: The URL or path holding the ``{placeholder}`` tokens.
        segments: Each placeholder name mapped to its unencoded members.

    Returns:
        ``template`` with every placeholder substituted, each member percent-encoded.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``template`` is empty, or names a placeholder ``segments`` has no entry

    One function for both kinds that need it: a path parameter and a query parameter are the same
    type, so they are the same rule -- a call's parameter replaces a global of the same key but
    keeps the global's position, so what an endpoint produces does not depend on which side supplied
    a parameter. Keys are unique within either side -- a collection is carried by a single
    :class:`Param` and expanded by its destination, never by repeating the key -- so replacing
    rather than appending is unambiguous.

    Both arguments share a type, so the precedence lives in their names rather than in the function
    name: ``global_params`` is what the API prescribes, ``call_params`` what this one call declares.

    Headers resolve separately, since they merge case-insensitively -- which ``render_headers`` gets
    by lowercasing as it renders. Placeholders in a *base URL* are server variables, carried on the
    :class:`UrlTemplate` itself and rendered by :func:`build_url`.
