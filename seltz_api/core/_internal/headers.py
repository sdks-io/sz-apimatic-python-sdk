"""Rendering, normalizing and resolving request headers.

One place decides how header names reach the wire, so the choice is made once rather than at each
endpoint. Names are lowercased: HTTP/1.1 treats them case-insensitively and HTTP/2 requires
lowercase, so lowercasing is correct for both and makes the produced mapping comparable.

Lowercasing is also what makes :func:`resolve_headers` case-insensitive by construction: once every
layer is normalized, an ordinary dict merge cannot let a differently-cased duplicate through.

The layers are not all the same kind, and that asymmetry is deliberate. The API's and the endpoint's
headers are :class:`Param`s -- spec-derived, so each names the type it was declared as and is
rendered through it by :func:`render_headers`. A caller's ``extra_headers`` arrives as a plain
mapping of strings, because a caller-supplied value carries no declared type for an adapter to act
on.

``Cookie`` is the one field this module knows by name. Every other field takes the later layer and
discards the earlier; RFC 6265 §5.4 permits at most one ``Cookie``, so its contributors fold into a
single jar instead."""

    Rendering and lowercasing in one pass is what keeps :func:`resolve_headers` an ordinary dict
    merge; within one layer the later of two same-named headers wins, which falls out of the dict.
    ``Cookie`` is the exception: its contributors fold into one jar, so an endpoint's own cookie and
    the credential a scheme appended after it survive each other.

    A header contributing nothing -- a ``None`` value, or a collection with no members -- is omitted
    rather than sent empty, so a lower layer's value survives. Several values fold into one
    comma-separated field value: RFC 9110's own rule for a repeated header, and OpenAPI's default
    ``style: simple`` for a header array, with no space after the comma. Folding here is also what
    keeps ``HttpRequest.headers`` a plain ``Mapping[str, str]``, so no transport has to learn that a
    header can be multi-valued.

    Args:
        headers: The header parameters; ``None`` is treated as none at all.

    Returns:
        Lowercased header names mapped to one field value each; a header contributing nothing is

    Every layer is normalized before merging, so a global ``X-Tenant`` is overridden by an
    endpoint's ``x-tenant`` rather than reaching the wire alongside it -- and a caller's
    ``extra_headers`` wins over both. That it can override a header the endpoint set is the point of
    passing it, not an oversight.

    ``Cookie`` is the one field a later layer does not replace. RFC 6265 §5.4 permits at most one of
    them, so the layers' cookies are several entries in a single jar rather than competing claims on
    one slot: a caller adding a cookie adds to the credential a scheme contributed instead of
    silently discarding it.

    ``extra_headers`` is keyword-only. It no longer shares a type with the two layers below it, so
    an inversion would now be caught -- but it stays keyword-only regardless: the two spec-derived
    layers are still same-typed and positional, and a caller layer reading as a third peer would
    misrepresent it as something the API prescribes.
