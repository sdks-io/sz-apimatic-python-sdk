"""One declared value, one wire-ready form.

Every request parameter -- query, form, path, header, or a base URL's server variable -- reaches
the wire the same way: validated against the type the endpoint declared, dumped through that
type's adapter, and turned into text. Only the *arrangement* differs, and that stays with each
destination: :mod:`.form` explodes values into ``key[sub]`` pairs, :mod:`.urls` joins them into
``/``-separated segments, :mod:`.headers` folds them into one field value.

That shared prefix lives here, which is why a ``datetime`` declared ``RFC1123DateTime`` renders as
its GMT string at every destination without any of them knowing what a datetime is -- and why a
fifth destination would need no serialization code of its own."""

    """``param``'s value in wire form: validated against its declared type, then dumped.

    The same two steps, in the same order, as :func:`json_body` -- and the reason a parameter
    holds its resolved adapter rather than the type expression it came from. Validation coerces
    dict-shaped input (``Model | FooDict`` companions) through the model's own rules; the dump
    applies the type's serializer, which is what renders an ``RFC1123DateTime`` as its GMT string,
    an enum as its value and a model under its wire aliases.

    A validation failure is re-raised naming the parameter: pydantic titles the error by the
    *type* (``1 validation error for int``), which on an endpoint with five parameters leaves the
    caller guessing which one failed. ``ValidationError`` subclasses ``ValueError``, so a caller's
    ``except ValueError`` covers both spellings, and the full per-field detail rides ``__cause__``.

    ``strip_unset`` is what drops a field the caller never touched, and the only thing that can:
    ``UnsetType`` is not ``None``, so the dump keeps the key and it serializes as ``null``, which a
    JSON-encoded path segment or header value would carry verbatim. An *explicit* ``None`` is
    kept -- see docs/designs/optional-nullable-fields.md. Which of those nulls survives is the
    destination's own decision, taken in :func:`text_values` and ``flattening.flatten``: compact
    JSON can spell one, a query pair or a flat path segment cannot.

    The result is still structured -- a collection stays a list, a model stays a mapping -- because
    the query and form destination needs that shape to explode into ``key[sub]`` keys.

    Args:
        param: The parameter to render, carrying its declared type's adapter.

    Returns:
        The dumped value, still structured; a top-level set is sorted so one call yields one URL.
