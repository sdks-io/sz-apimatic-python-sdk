"""Request bodies: the wire shapes a transport receives, and the factories that build them.

A body is already serialized by the time it exists -- except file content, which is deliberately
the opposite: a file is *described* (a ``Path``, a handle, an iterable of chunks) and first read
inside the transport when the request is sent, so building a body never opens a resource. Each
factory validates any typed value against the type the endpoint declared and dumps it through that
type's adapter, so a transport, including a caller-supplied one, never serializes anything, and
:class:`HttpRequest` never carries a pydantic adapter.

``RequestBody`` is a closed union rather than a Protocol: all five shapes live here and are
generator-emitted, so the set cannot grow behind the runtime's back."""

    call it could not be: ``json_body(employee, int)`` makes mypy solve ``T`` from *both*
    arguments and join them to ``object``, so every mismatch type-checks -- measured, along with
    the other shapes that fail the same way, in ADR-0013 (whose curried spelling this subscript
    replaced; the re-measurement is in docs/plans/subscripted-typed-factories.md).

    The factory declares no ``__call__``, so *omitting* the declared type is a build failure too:
    ``json_body(employee)`` is rejected statically (``[operator]``) -- the guarantee the curried
    signature used to carry. The runtime ``__call__`` below is invisible to type checkers and
    exists only to turn that same mistake into a guided ``TypeError``.

    The subscript is a ``TypeForm``, exactly as in ``json_decoder[...]``, so a runtime union alias
    (``Person``, which is ``Employee | Boss``) binds ``T`` as precisely as a concrete class does.

    The subscript is the endpoint's declared parameter type **in full**, dict-shaped companion
    included: ``json_body[Employee | EmployeeDict]``. The accepted value is then exactly ``T``, so
    there is no permissive mapping half for a stray ``dict[str, Any]`` to slip through -- and only
    the model arm reaches :func:`adapter_for`, via :func:`validation_target`, because a companion
    is an input shape and never a wire shape.

    Handles scalars, dicts, lists and nested structures, and honours ``Annotated`` serializers
    (``PlainSerializer`` and friends) because serialization goes through the type's own adapter.
    Validation runs before the dump, so dict-shaped input is coerced into the model through its own
    validation; a model instance passes through unchanged (``revalidate_instances`` defaults to
    ``"never"``), making this byte-identical for non-dict values. ``strip_unset`` then distinguishes
    a field the caller never touched (``OptionalNullable[...] = UNSET``, omitted) from one set
    explicitly to ``None`` (kept as null) -- see docs/designs/optional-nullable-fields.md.

    ``media_type`` is the operation's content key -- ``application/json`` by default, and written at

    A binary field is emitted the same way whether its schema is one file or an array of them:
    ``file_part(name, value, media_type=...)`` with the parameter as declared, ``FileInput`` or
    ``list[FileInput]``. A list yields a :class:`MultipartFiles` that ``multipart_body`` unfolds
    into one :class:`MultipartFile` per item under the same name (RFC 7578's repeated field), each
    resolved exactly as a single file is -- so an item may be a ``NamedFile`` overriding its own
    filename or media type.

    ``media_type`` is the operation's declared one, defaulting to ``application/octet-stream`` -- RFC
    9110 8.3's answer for a payload of unknown type, and OpenAPI's own default for a binary part that
    declares none. An endpoint writes it only where the spec differs (ADR-0048), and a ``NamedFile``
    overrides whatever it is, per item for a list.

    **The filename is never read as a media type.** An extension is a claim the caller typed, not
    evidence about the bytes -- ``report.pdf`` may hold a PNG -- and checking would mean opening the
    content here, which nothing in this module does. ``application/octet-stream`` is what the SDK
    actually knows; a caller who knows better says so through ``NamedFile(content, media_type=...)``.

    **A list is always many files, and nothing has to arbitrate that.** One file's content streams
    as an ``Iterator[bytes]``, never a ``Sequence`` of them, so a ``list[bytes]`` satisfies only the
    first overload and the two arms do not overlap. A chunk *list* that is one file's content says
    so by handing over an iterator -- ``NamedFile(iter([b"a", b"b"]))`` -- and that is the whole of
    the rule (ADR-0049).

    The runtime agrees by a different route: PEP 634 defines a sequence pattern to exclude ``str``,
    ``bytes`` and ``bytearray``, the one place the language already knows a byte string is content
    rather than a collection, and an iterator is no ``Sequence`` at either level.
    ``isinstance(value, Sequence)`` would be true of ``bytes`` and send each byte as its own part.

    The overloads earn their keep beyond the return type: they give a heterogeneous list literal --
    ``[b"one", NamedFile(b"two", filename="2.bin")]`` -- an element type to check against. Collapsed
    into one signature over a union, that literal joins to ``list[object]`` and is rejected.

    Nothing is opened or read here -- the content descriptor is carried as given, and the first read
    happens in the transport when the request is sent.

    A part with no filename reads as a form *field* rather than a file to many servers (measured:
    ASP.NET's ``IFormFile`` binding requires one). Bare ``bytes`` and a nameless reader derive no
    filename -- deliberately, since the underlying library's fallback is the literal string
    ``"upload"`` -- so name them through ``NamedFile(content, filename=...)`` when the operation
    expects a file.

    """``text_body[T](value)`` -- a text body whose *type* picks the wire text and whose *charset*
    picks the bytes.

    ``text_body[Base64AsciiEncodedBytes](data)`` is what carries an operation whose whole body is a
    base64 string: validation passes the raw bytes through, the dump encodes -- the encoding is the
    declared type's own dump, not a call at the emission site. It is fully resident by construction,
    and the peak is about **3.7x** the payload: the caller's ``bytes``, the base64 ``str`` at 1.33x,
    and the transport's ``encode(charset)`` of that at 1.33x again. Base64 has no streaming path here
    -- the parameter is ``bytes``, so a caller cannot hand over a stream to begin with. It *is*
    chunkable at any multiple of three bytes should a spec ever need it; the arm is absent rather
    than impossible (ADR-0051 decision 6). The two
    keywords come from the operation's content key, split once at emission: the type and any other
    parameters in ``media_type``, the ``charset`` parameter on its own -- and each is written only
    where the spec differs from the default (``text/plain``, ``utf-8``), the rule ``param``'s
    ``serialization_format`` set."""
